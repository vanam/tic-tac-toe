# TIC TAC TOE 2.0
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/vanam/tic-tac-toe.svg?branch=java)](https://travis-ci.com/vanam/tic-tac-toe)

* Language: Java
* Implementation notes: [NOTES.md](NOTES.md)


We want to bring the pen-and-paper game Tic-tac-toe to the digital age,
but with a little twist: the size of the playfield should be
configurable between 3x3 and 10x10. And we also want the symbols
(usually O and X) to be configurable. Also it should be for 3 players
instead of just 2.


General Rules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)


The two users will play against each other and against the computer.
Who is starting is random. In and output should be on the console.
After each move, the new state of the playfield is displayed and the
player can enter the next position of their character one after
another. The next position should be provided in a format like 3,2.
Invalid inputs are expected to be handled appropriately.


## Requirements:

- Use the programming language you feel most comfortable with
- The game takes 3 inputs:
    - Size of the playground. Valid values are between 3 and 10.
    - Play character 1, 2 and 3:
        - A single character for the human player 1
        - A single character for the human player 2
        - A single character for the computer
- These configurations should come from a file
- Software design is more important than a highly developed AI
- Please put the completed assignment on GitHub.


## Rules:

- You may use external libraries only for testing or building purposes
e.g. JUnit, Gradle, Rspec, Rake, GulpJS, etc.
- Please provide an explanation how to run your code
- Please explain your design decisions and assumptions
- Don't include executables* in your submission.
- Please write your solution in a way, that you would feel comfortable
handing this over to a colleague and deploy it into production.
- We especially look at design aspects (e.g. OOP) and if the code is
well tested and understandable.
